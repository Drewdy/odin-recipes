    alt="Scotsman's Shepherd Pie">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Yes, shepherd's pie is predominantly thought of as Irish or British. But since I'm Scottish, I thought I'd give
    it a unique twist to suit my ancestral tastes. The use of lamb, the smoky, heather taste of Guinness® Draught
    (Irish, I admit), and the topping of sharp Cheddar and smoked paprika give this version its unique, smoky-sweet
    flavor.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>5 cups mashed, boiled potatoes</li>
    <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
    <li>2 ounces cream cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
    <li>1 egg yolk</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Stir potatoes, sour cream, cream cheese, 1 tablespoon butter, egg yolk, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon
        black pepper together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet or nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add ground lamb, reduce heat to
        medium, and cook, stirring frequently, until browned and crumbly, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour off excess grease and
        season lamb with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Stir tomatoes with juice, onion, and carrot into ground lamb; simmer until vegetables are tender, 5 to 10
        minutes. Add peas, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, until peas are warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Heat beer in a saucepan over medium heat; add beef bouillon. Cook and stir beer mixture until bouillon is
        dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a separate pan over medium-low heat until sizzling. Whisk flour into
        butter until thick and paste-like, about 1 minute. Stir beer mixture and Worcestershire sauce into flour
        mixture until gravy is smooth and thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir gravy into lamb mixture and simmer until
        mixture is thickened, at least 5 minutes.</li>
